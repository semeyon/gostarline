This is very simple experiment to see how GitHub Copilot and https://developer.starline.ru works.

Results:
- GitHub Copilot is a quite good tool to bootstrap projects and extend them.
- https://developer.starline.ru API is very unstable and has a very savvier issue, but it was a fan to investigate and play around!
